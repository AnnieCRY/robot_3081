This is a U\+ML Class Diagram of a \hyperlink{classRobot}{Robot} Simulation. A user controls the robot with the arrow keys. The objective of the game is to touch all of the bases without running into (eventually moving) obstacles or walls. The robot is given 9 lives at the beginning of the game, but it will lose a life with every collision. The Graphic\+Arena\+Viewer class initiate the arena which works as the interface of the robot world and the user, receiving user input. In the meantime, it reads the get the states of entities through arena class and draws the entities in the G\+UI window. \hyperlink{classArena}{Arena} create base and the mobile Entity and the immobile Entity. All the arena entity event is pass to arena and then pass to each arena entity. For the mobile entity, we have motion handler and motion behavior class. Obastacle and robot have their own handler for dealing their movement.\hypertarget{index_install_sec}{}\section{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
